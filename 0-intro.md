# Introduction 

<details>
<summary><strong>What is <code>JavaScript</code>?</strong></summary>

<br>

JavaScript is the brain behind websites.

###  Think of it like this:

- HTML = "This is a button"  
- CSS = "Make the button pink and cute"  
- JavaScript = "When I click the button, show me a cat meme"

###  What Can JS Do?

- Make websites interactive (like buttons, sliders, dropdowns)  
- Control what shows/hides on the page  
- Handle user input (forms, logins, etc)  
- Create animations or games  
- Build full apps (like Netflix, Spotify, Instagram clone)

###  Where it runs?

- In your browser (like Chrome, Firefox)  
- On the server (using **Node.js** ‚Äî that backend hotness you're learning)

### üëÄ Real-life examples:

- You click "Add to Cart" on Amazon ‚Üí JS is doing the work  
- Insta shows a reel without reloading ‚Üí JS again  
- You type in a search box and suggestions pop up? Yup, JavaScript

> <div style="border-left: 3px solid #444; padding-left: 12px; height: 100%;">
> JavaScript makes websites come alive ‚Äî it‚Äôs what makes stuff *do things*, not just sit there looking pretty 
> </div>

### ‚ùì Can we run JavaScript outside the browser?   
  #### üí° Short Answer: Not directly.
JavaScript was originally made to run inside browsers only, using something called a JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, etc). These engines read and execute JS code within the browser environment.

## Who is Ryan Dahl?
#### Ryan Dahl is a software engineer best known for creating **Node.js** ‚Äî the tool that made it possible to run **JavaScript** outside the browser
